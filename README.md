# Overview

FreshRSS is an RSS aggregator and reader. It allows you to read and follow several
news websites at a glance without the need to browse from one website to another.

# Usage

Step by step instructions on using the charm:

  $ juju deploy fresh-rss
  $ juju expose fresh-rss

You can then browse to http://ip-address to configure the service.

# Configuration

The configuration options will be listed on the charm store, however If you're
making assumptions or opinionated decisions in the charm (like setting a default
administrator password), you should detail that here so the user knows how to
change it immediately, etc.
